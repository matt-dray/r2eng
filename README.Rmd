Make R speakable!

The goal of {r2eng} (as in 'R to English') is to take an R expression and 'translate' it to an English sentence. 

The package is intended to:

* improve communication between teachers and learners
* make R discussions in English more accessible to non-English speakers
* provide an extra audio evaluation tool for users who are blind or have low vision
* be of interest to any R user that's curious about how R expressions might be vocalised

The project was inspired by [Amelia McNamara](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN){target='_blank'}'s useR! 2020 talk called 'Speaking R' ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc){target='_blank'}, [slides](https://www.amelia.mn/SpeakingR/#1){target='_blank'}).

This project is a work in progress and highly opinionated. Contributions are welcome, but please see the [Code of Conduct](#conduct){target='_blank'}.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {r2eng} from GitHub with:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/r2eng")
```

This package depends on {lintr}, {purrr} and {rlang}.

## Examples

The main function in the package is `translate()`. It uses [non-standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html){target='_blank'}, so you pass it a bare R expression like this:

```{r example-basic}
r2eng::translate(variable <- 1, speak = TRUE)
```

Set `speak = TRUE` for a system call that will read the English sentence out loud (macOS only).

A more complex example:

```{r example-complex}
obj <- r2eng::translate(
  hello <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 'banana' %in% c('apple', 'orange')),
  speak = FALSE
)

obj
```

### Methods

An `r2eng` object has the methods `speak` and `evaluate`.

Use `speak` to launch a system call that will vocalise the translated English sentence for the given R expression (macOS only).

```{r example-speak}
r2eng::speak(obj)
```

Use `evaluate` to evaluate the expression.

```{r example-eval}
r2eng::evaluate(obj, speak = FALSE)
hello
```

Use `print` to print the R expression and English sentence.

```{r example-print}
print(obj)
```

From your r2eng object you can access the original R expression (`r_expression`), English translation (`eng_expression`), quoted expression (`quoted_expression`). You can also access the parse tree output via {lintr} (`translation_map`):

```{r example-map}
head(obj$translation_map)
```

### Further examples

Here's an example using the pipe (`%>%`) and two types of 'equals':

```{r example-pipe-equals}
library(magrittr)
r2eng::translate(
  mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 22) %>% mutate(gear4 = gear == 4),
  speak = FALSE
)
```

This example uses the 'plus' constructor from {ggplot2}:

```{r example-ggplot}
r2eng::translate(
  ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(),
  speak = FALSE
)
```

This example shows what happens when you pass vectors:

```{r example-vectors}
r2eng::translate(
  plot(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(5, 6, 7)),
  speak = FALSE
)
```

### Passing a string

The `translate()` function understands the meaning of `=` when used for assignment versus specifying arguments, but feeding an expression such as `x = c(1, 2, 3)` would confuse `translate()` that you want to pass an argument `c(1, 2, 3)` to the parameter `x`. 

This is because `translate()` uses [non-standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html){target='_blank'}. 

In such cases, you must use `translate_string()` instead:

```{r example-basic-string}
r2eng::translate_string("x = c(1, 2, 3)", speak = FALSE)
```

Another exceptional case for `translate_string()` is when piping and expression:

```{r example-string-pipe}
"non_english <- c('ceci n est pas une pipe', 'Ich bin ein Berliner', '我其實唔識講廣東話')" %>% 
  r2eng::translate_string(speak = FALSE)
```

## RStudio addin

Installing this package also installs an [RStudio addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/){target='_blank'}.

Select an R expression in the editor and then under 'Addins', go to 'Speak R Expression In English' under 'R2ENG'. The selected text will be spoken by your computer. 

You could bind this addin to a keyboard shortcut in RStudio by going to 'Tools', then 'Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...'. Perhaps <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.

As with the rest of this package, vocalisation is only possible for macOS and with speakers.

Another Addin function is also available, 'Print R Expression In English', which prints a selected R expression and its English translation
